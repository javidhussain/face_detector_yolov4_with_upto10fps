# face_detector_yolov4_with_upto10fps
This project is based on face detection and tracking on rasberryPi. 


Usually using a full Yolov4 on RasberryPi consumes more then 80% of the cpu utilization for object detection.
This project demonstrates the use of YoloV4 and optimized object tacking methods to detect and track face on RasberryPi.
